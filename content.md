# Design Patterns - Content Overview

## Overview Directory

The **Overview** directory contains foundational object-oriented programming concepts that are essential for understanding design patterns:

### 1. Objects Passed by Reference
Understanding how Python handles object references when passing objects to functions.

### 2. Polymorphism
How the same method call can produce different behaviors based on the actual object type.

### 3. Interfaces in Python
How interfaces (classes with only abstract methods) define contracts that implementing classes must follow.

These fundamental concepts form the building blocks for more advanced design patterns covered in subsequent directories.
